# Supply Chain, Retail & Product Analytics — A Decision-Focused Lab

This repository is a living analytics and thinking lab where I explore how data, constraints, and systems interact to shape decisions in retail, supply chain, and marketplace environments.

Rather than treating analytics as reporting, this work focuses on how insights influence **operational choices, product behavior, and system design** — particularly in areas like demand uncertainty, inventory trade-offs, returns, fulfillment, and pricing.

### 🛠 The Lab Framework
The projects and notes here combine:
* **Supply chain and retail fundamentals**
* **Data analysis, modeling, and simulation**
* **Product & systems-thinking** focused on real-world constraints

## 🚀 Projects

<details>
<summary><b>Project 1: Olist Logistics — From "Dumb Multipliers" to Dynamic Visibility</b></summary>

### The Problem
Olist relied on a **static 2× multiplier** for delivery ETAs to mask high logistics variance. In major hubs like São Paulo, this meant promising a **12-day delivery** for a journey that physically takes **~5 days**, significantly hurting checkout conversion rates.

### The Insight
Data analysis revealed that the “chaos” (standard deviation) in the Brazilian postal system is roughly equal to the average transit time itself. A purely mathematical fix—simply shortening the ETA—would push late deliveries to ~15–20%, creating a customer-support nightmare.

### The Recommendation
Shift the product strategy from **accuracy** (guessing a single “safe” date) to **transparency** (showing the journey). By implementing real-time milestone tracking, Olist can:
* Offer more aggressive early estimates.
* Use information—not time padding—to buffer chaos when delays actually occur.

## 💡 Why this repository exists

I’m interested in roles at the intersection of **analytics, operations, and product**, where data is used not just to explain outcomes, but to guide decisions under real constraints. 

This repository serves as:
1.  **A personal learning archive**
2.  **A thinking surface** for complex systems
3.  **A way to articulate** how analytics connects to business and product impact

> **How this repository evolves:** This is not a finished curriculum. It grows through small, focused explorations, revisions, and learnings — similar to how real-world understanding develops on the job.

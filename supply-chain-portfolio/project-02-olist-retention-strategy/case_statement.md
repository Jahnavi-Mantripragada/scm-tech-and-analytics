# Project 02: Case Statement

## Title  
**The "Leaky Bucket" Investigation: Quantifying the Impact of Logistics Friction on Customer Retention**

---

## 1. The Problem (The "Fire")
Olist faces a **critical retention crisis**, with a **Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR) of just 3.12%**.  
This indicates that the cost of acquiring new customers is not being offset by long-term customer value, making the current growth model **unsustainable**.

---

## 2. The Primary Hypothesis
The **“Trust Tax”**—created by high logistics variance and the **safety buffers** identified in *Project 01*—is the primary driver of churn.

Customers use Olist for **high-intent, niche purchases** but do not return for **high-frequency habits** due to **post-purchase dissonance**.

---

## 3. The Objectives

### Segment the Churn
Determine whether churn is driven by:
- **Product type** (durable vs. consumable), or  
- **Experience** (delivery lateness / uncertainty)

### Find the "Breaking Point"
Identify the **delivery-delay threshold** at which a customer’s probability of returning effectively drops to zero.

### Design the "Recovery Playbook"
Propose a **product intervention**—such as proactive compensation or real-time milestone transparency—to rescue **at-risk customer relationships**.

## Strategy Note: The "Logistics-to-Loyalty" Bridge
In *Project 01*, we examined the **system**.  
In *Project 02*, we examine the **human**.

We move from:
> *“Is the truck on time?”*  
to  
> *“Does the customer care if the truck is on time?”*

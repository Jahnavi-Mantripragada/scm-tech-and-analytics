## Hypothesis: The Regional Trust Gap

The **trust gap** is **geographic**.

In **competitive hubs (SP)**, the **2× safety buffer** acts as a **repellent**,  
pushing users back to **Amazon** or **Mercado Libre**.

In **remote hubs (AC)**, the same **2× buffer** is accepted as the **cost of access**.

## Verification Plan
Build a **Master Geo-Health** table to test whether a higher **system gap**  
(*Project 01*) correlates with a lower **retention rate** (*Project 02*)  
in **high-volume states**.

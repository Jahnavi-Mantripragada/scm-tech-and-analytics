## Supporting Evidence: Delivery Error Comparison

| is_repeat | Average Delivery Error (Days) |
|----------:|------------------------------:|
| False     | -11.83                        |
| True      | -12.64                        |

**Interpretation:**  
The average delivery error is **nearly identical** for repeat customers and one-timers.  
Both groups receive their orders **~12 days earlier** than promised, reinforcing the conclusion that **delivery earliness is not the primary driver of churn**.


## Key Finding
If **lateness is nearly identical** for both repeat customers and one-timers, then **logistics is not the smoking gun** for churn.

---

## Strategic Implication
This insight forces an immediate strategy shift.  
If being **“early” by 12 days** doesn’t increase repeat behavior, the problem isn’t delivery speed — it’s something deeper in **product–market fit**.

## Updating the Testable Claims (The Pivot)
Your earlier hypotheses around:
- **Durable Goods** (Claim B), and  
- **Niche Utility** (Claim C)  

now become the **primary leads** in the investigation.

---

## New Theory
Customers aren’t leaving because they’re **angry about delivery**.  
They’re leaving because they **got exactly what they came for** and don’t need Olist again.

Olist is being treated like a **hardware store**  
*(you buy a hammer once)*  
rather than a **supermarket**  
*(you buy milk every week)*.

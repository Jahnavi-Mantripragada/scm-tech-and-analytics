## Claims to Test

### Claim A — Logistics
Repeat customers experience **lower delivery error** (less lateness) than one-time buyers.

One-time purchases are dominated by **durable goods** (Home, Auto, Electronics), which naturally have **long replacement cycles**.

**High price friction** discourages repeat visits; customers return to Olist only when they find a specific **deal** or **niche item**.

### Claim D — Geography
Customers in states with the **largest system gaps** (identified in *Project 01*) are the **least likely to return**.

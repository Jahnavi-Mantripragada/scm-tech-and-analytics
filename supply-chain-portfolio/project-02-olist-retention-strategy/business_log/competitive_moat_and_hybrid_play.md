## Key Section: Competitive Moat & Vertical Integration

### The Moat
In the **South (SP)**, Olist’s moat is **shallow** because competitors like **Mercado Libre** own their warehouses and control fulfillment end-to-end.

In the **North (AC)**, Olist’s moat is **deep** because it provides **access** where competitors cannot reliably operate.

### Vertical Integration
Today, Olist operates as a **light marketplace** (no owned inventory).

To close the **trust gap**, Olist should evolve toward a **hybrid model**:
- Use data to identify **high-demand SKUs** in remote regions
- Hold this inventory in **regional micro-hubs**
- Leverage faster, more reliable fulfillment to **lock in regional advantage**

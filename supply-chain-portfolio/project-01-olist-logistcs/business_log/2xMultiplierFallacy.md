# The "2x" Multiplier Fallacy

## Observation
The system consistently over-estimates delivery by roughly **100%** across different geographies  
*(SP: 5 vs 12, AC: 17 vs 33)*.

## The Insight
The ETA algorithm likely applies a **"worst-case scenario" multiplier** to ensure a **99% On-Time Delivery (OTD)** rate.

## The Trade-off
While OTD remains high, the system sacrifices **market competitiveness**.  
A more **aggressive ETA** (e.g., *Actual + 20% buffer*) would make the platform feel significantly faster to users.

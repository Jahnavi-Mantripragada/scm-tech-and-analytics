Title: The "On-Time Seller" Paradox

Observation: 94.5% of sellers meet the shipping_limit_date.

The Insight: Lateness is not a "People" problem (Sellers being lazy); it is a "System" problem (The ETA algorithm).

Trade-off: We don't need to "punish" sellers. We need to "fix" the math. Adding a seller penalty feature would be a waste of engineering time.

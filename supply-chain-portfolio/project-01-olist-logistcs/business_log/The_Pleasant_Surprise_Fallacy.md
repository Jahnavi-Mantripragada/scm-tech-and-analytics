Your logic—"Under-promise and over-deliver"—is a very common service strategy. It leads to "Delight." However, in a competitive marketplace like e-commerce, that strategy has a hidden cost that can kill the business.

## Why "Pleasantly Surprised" is sometimes a "Product Failure"
As a Product Manager, you have to look at the Conversion Funnel.

1. The "Lost Sale" (Conversion): Imagine a customer needs a birthday gift. They see your product. The system says "Delivery in 8 days" (because of that 6-day buffer). They go to a competitor who says "Delivery in 2 days."

 > Result: You lost the customer entirely. They never got the chance to be "pleasantly surprised" because the long estimate scared them away.

2. The "Inventory Velocity" Problem: If your system thinks everything takes 6 days to move, it might tell a seller to hold onto stock or order less, slowing down the entire "turn" of the marketplace.

3. The "Expectation Treadmill": Once customers realize you always deliver in 2 days despite saying 8, they stop trusting your dates entirely. They start "guessing" your logic, which leads to support tickets: "You said 8 days, but usually it's 2... where is my stuff?"

## The "Other Way" (The Risk of being too aggressive)
You said: "I think, it should other-way only." If you mean we should be more aggressive (Promise 2 days when it might take 4):

* The "Support" Nightmare: This is the "Burning Problem" we discussed. Late deliveries lead to refunds, bad reviews, and high "Customer Acquisition Costs" because people don't come back.

## The "Product Manager's" Solution: Dynamic Precision
A Great PM doesn't want to be "Safe" (Long buffers) or "Risky" (Short buffers). They want to be Accurate.

* The Goal: If Seller A ships in 1 hour, promise 2 days. If Seller B ships in 5 days, promise 7 days.

* The Leverage: This is why we are looking at the data. We want to prove to the business: "Look, we are losing sales because our 'System Buffer' is a 'Dumb' 6-day default."

Instead of a simple multiplier, sophisticated systems use **standard deviations**.  
This is how companies like Amazon and Delhivery calculate ETAs.

## The Formula
**ETA = Average Time + (K × Standard Deviation)**

### Average Time  
The physical reality  
*(e.g., 5.1 days for SP)*

### Standard Deviation  
The **“chaos factor”**  
How much does delivery time vary?

### K (Service Level Factor)  
A **product decision**, not a technical one.

- **K = 1** → ~84% on-time delivery  
- **K = 2** → ~97% on-time delivery

## Why This Is Better
In **São Paulo**, the chaos factor is low because roads and infrastructure are good.  
In **Acre**, the chaos factor is high due to river transport and logistics uncertainty.

A **smart system** adds:
- a **small buffer** for SP  
- a **large buffer** for AC  

instead of bluntly **doubling ETAs everywhere**.

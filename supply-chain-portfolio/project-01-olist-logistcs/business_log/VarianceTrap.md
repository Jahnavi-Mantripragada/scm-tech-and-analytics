# The Variance Trap

## Finding
While the **average delivery time in SP** is fast (~5 days), the **high standard deviation** (~5.5 days) creates a long **tail of late deliveries**.

## The Insight
Olist’s current **12-day ETA promise** is actually **aggressive**, not lazy.  
They are consciously taking a **service-level risk** to remain competitive.

## Trade-off
If we want to reduce the ETA further, we shouldn’t change the math —  
we need to change the **physics**.

That means working with carriers to **reduce variance / standard deviation**, not just tightening buffers.

## 1. The Hunch
I am focusing on **Internal System Accuracy**. My hunch is that our **Estimated Delivery Logic** is decoupled from the actual performance of our partners (Sellers and Carriers).

## 2. Defining the Boundary
- **Internal (System):** The Olist platform, the ETA algorithm, and the communication tech.
- **Partners (Execution):** The Sellers (packing) and Carriers (shipping).

## 3. The "Small" Decision/Problem
Should the Product Team redesign the ETA algorithm to be more "Conservative" (adding buffer time) or "Dynamic" (changing based on the specific Seller's history)?

## 4. Why this matters?
If we promise 5 days and it takes 6, the customer is mad. If we promise 8 days and it takes 6, the customer is delighted. I want to see how often our 'Tech Promise' fails the 'Partner Reality'.

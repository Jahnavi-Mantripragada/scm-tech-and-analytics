## What Surprised Me
I initially thought the **2× multiplier** was just *padding*.  
The math shows that when **variance is high**, a large buffer is a **necessity**, not a choice.

## The Correction
My assumption that the system was **“lazy”** was wrong.  
In **SP**, the system is actually **risk-taking**.

## The Algorithm Limit
Predictive models only give us **visibility into chaos** — they don’t remove it.  
A *smart ETA* that accounts for a **5-day variance** is still a **5-day window**.

To truly improve the product, we must reduce the **spread** (*standard deviation*),  
not just move the **target** (*mean*).

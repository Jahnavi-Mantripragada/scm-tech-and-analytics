## What Surprised Me
I initially assumed the **2× multiplier** was just padding.  
The math shows that when **variance is high**, a large buffer is a **necessity**, not a choice.

## The Correction
My assumption that the system was **“lazy”** was wrong.  
In **SP**, the system is actually being **risk-taking**.

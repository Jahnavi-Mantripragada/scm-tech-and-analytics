## Why I Chose This Cut
I wanted to see if the **internal tech** was smart enough to adjust for Brazil’s geography.

## What Surprised Me
The system *is* geographically aware (it knows Acre is slower than SP), but it is **equally pessimistic everywhere**.

## Next Step
I want to test whether this padding is actually **saving us from late deliveries**, or if we are just being **“safe” for no reason**.

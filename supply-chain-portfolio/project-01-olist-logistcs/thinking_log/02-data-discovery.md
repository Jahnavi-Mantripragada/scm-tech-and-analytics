I expected the system to be smart, but I found a 6-day hard-coded default. I am shifting my focus from 'Sellers are slow' to 'The System is lazy'.


What surprised me: I thought sellers would be the bottleneck. I was wrong.

The Pivot: I am moving my investigation from the "First Mile" (Seller) to the "Last Mile" (Carrier Transit Time).
